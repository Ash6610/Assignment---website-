       <div id='grad1'><p style="font-size: 150%; padding-top: 7px; text-align: center;">The Dambulla Cave Temple</p></div><br><br>
       <P style="font-size: medium;background-color:rgb(245, 228, 205, 0.384);">Cave of the Great Kings
            The Buddhist temple complex of Dambulla consists of five cave temples 
            carved under a very large overhanging rock. The temples were carved out
             over several centuries, but the oldest dates back to the 1st century B.C.E.
              The temples include numerous carved statues of Buddha, and his faithful disciple Ananda,
               as well as Hindu deities.<br><br>
            
            The largest of the caves is known as the Maharaja Vihara Lena, 
            or Cave of the Great Kings, so named because the cave contains the 
            statues of two ancient, great Sri Lankan kings—Valagambahu and Nissankamalla.
             Fifty or so Buddha statues, including a life-sized granite one, are all contained 
             inside the temple as is small stupa surrounded by eleven seated Buddhas.</P><br><br>

              <P style="background-color: rgb(245, 228, 205, 0.384);font-size: medium;">The cave walls and ceiling are entirely painted with paintings depicting early 
            Buddhist historical events and murals with traditional Buddhist designs. Like all
             the other cave temples, this one is dimly lit, preserving the vibrant colors of the paintings and murals.<br><br>
            
            Another unusual feature of this particular cave temple is the large metal bowl that was placed
             inside the cave centuries ago, presumably to catch rain dripping from the cave roof. It's said
              that even in a severe drought, the water in the bowl does not dry up.<br><br>
            
            Dambulla is one of the UNESCO World Heritage sites located in the region known
            as Sri Lanka's Cultural Triangle. If you ever go to Sri Lanka, you must go to Dambulla. 
            It is a very unique and spectacular site!</p><br><br>

        <br><P style="font-size: medium;background-color:rgb(245, 228, 205, 0.384);">Missing Yala National Park while Sri Lanka 
            sightseeing might bring regret to wildlife lovers. It is home
             to a host of wildlife and birds you are bound to run into a group 
             of elephants bathing in streams, tossing their trunks wildly or leopards
              nestling lazily on tree branches. You could opt for the safari drives or
               a nature trail among the thick green foliage of the forest. Some tourists
                also camp at Yala and enjoy a barbeque under the stars. With so much to see 
                and do here, Yala is indeed one of the best tourist places in Sri Lanka. Yala is
                 the perfect place to try your hand at wildlife photography.<br><br>

                  <P style="font-size: medium;background-color:rgb(245, 228, 205, 0.384);">Sri Lanka has a coastline of over 
                    1600 km and is ideally suited for windsurfing, speed boating, and other water sports. Arugam 
                    Bay has azure skies and slanting coconut trees. If you are looking to surf in turquoise waters,
                     Arugam Bay must be in your list of must-see tourist places in Sri Lanka. It is on the southeast
                      coast around 320 km from Colombo.<br><br>

                    Besides Arugam bay, other beaches among best places to visit in Sri Lanka are Unawatuna in the South; 
                    and Tangalla again in the south around 195 km south of Colombo.<br><br>
                    
                    How to get there- Colombo has an international airport and is strategically located. 
                    So if you fly to Colombo, you are pretty much in close proximity to the best beaches.</P><br><br>

                         Fort area has wide cobblestoned roads and a number of eateries and cafes. Try and catch
                          the sunset while you are there. There are a number of trinket shops and galleries that you can visit.
                           It is among the most visited places in Sri Lanka. </P><br><br>

                       <P style="font-size: medium;background-color:rgb(245, 228, 205, 0.384);">One of the most famous temples in all of Sri Lanka is located in Kandy,
                        the Temple of the Tooth (Sri Dalada Maligawa). It was built in the 
                         century and proudly boasts it is the home of Buddha’s tooth.
                          The tooth is kept in a two-story inner shrine fronted by two 
                          large elephant tusks. The relic rests on a solid gold lotus flower, 
                          encased in jeweled caskets that sit on a throne. Basically, it is safely 
                          tucked away in a gold casket to be revered by all Sri Lankans.</P><br><br>

                           <P style="font-size: medium;background-color:rgb(245, 228, 205, 0.384);">According to legend, the tooth was taken from the
 Buddha as he lay on his funeral pyre. It was smuggled to Sri Lanka in 313 AD, hidden
  in the hair of Princess Hemamali who fled the Hindu armies besieging her father’s kingdom in India. 
  But for mere mortals the important thing to know is that the temple is really beautiful and is most 
  definitely the highlight of Kandy town. It’s situated on the lake and has a little moat wrapping around the
   outside which doesn’t really deter anyone or any monkey; but it makes it look lovely.</P>
