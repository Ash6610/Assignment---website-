                <p>Sri Lanka is an island country located off the
                 southern coast of India. Sri Lanka is surrounded by the
                  Indian Ocean, Gulf of Mannar, the Palk Strait, and lies in 
                  the vicinity of India and the Maldives. The geography of Sri 
                  Lanka includes coastal plains in the north and hills and mountains 
                  in the interior. The government system is a republic; the chief of
                   state and head of government is the president. Sri Lanka has transitioned
                    to a market-orientated economy, but the central government is still involved 
                    in economic planning. Sri Lanka is a member of the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement
                     (APTA) and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).</p>

                    <p> Tourism in Sri Lanka is growing rapidly. For centuries, Sri Lanka has been a popular place of attraction
                      for foreign travelers. The Chinese traveler Fa-Hien visited Sri Lanka as early as the 4th century, and
                       in the 12th century, Italian explorer Marco Polo claimed Sri Lanka to be the <strong>"best island of its size in the world‚Äù</strong>.<br><br>
            The government initiatives in development of 
            tourism date back to 1937 when the Ceylon Tourist Bureau was
             established. However, it was closed down in September 1939 due to World
                 War II. After Sri Lanka's independence the promotion of tourism was again considered 
             by re-establishing the Ceylon Tourist Board which took over the function of the Tourist Bureau.
             More formal recognition for the country's tourism sector was given with the enactment of Act No.
              10 of 1966. This provided the legislation for the establishment of Ceylon Tourist Board. Since then
               the Ceylon Tourist Board has functioned as the state agency, responsible for development and promotion 
            of the tourism sector in Sri Lanka.<br><br>

           In October 2007 according to Section 2 of the
             Tourism Act No. 38 of 2005, the Sri Lanka Tourist Board 
        (Act No 10 of 1966) was replaced by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development
       Authority (SLTDA).Currently Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority has 
        classified Sri Lanka into several resort regions suitable for tourism development.</p>
